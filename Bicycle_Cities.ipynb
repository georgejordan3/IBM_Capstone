        "## Introduction \r\n",
        "I am a competitive cyclist and moving to Denver was partially motivated by my love for cycling. While I have a strong understanding of what it is like to ride here, I wonder how my experience compares to other cyclists in various parts of the US. I hope to tell a detailed story of these cities through the eyes of a cyclist and through the lens of data.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In this project, I will examine a list of the highest ranking bicycle cities in the country and apply my own analysis to gain further insight into the cities and their unique characteristics. I will use analytic tools as well as machine learning algorithms to see how these cities relate to each other and also gain insight into other supporting factors that have made these cities accessible via bicycle.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "While this project is personally interesting to me, I believe that the insights here could be useful for a variety of business applications. Perhaps there is a company in one of these cities that is considering including provisions to support bike commuters. Maybe the existence of bicycle infrastructure is important to a company and an investigation into potential locations for an office would require such an analysis to foster that kind of culture in the workplace.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I believe that the bicycle is a very powerful tool to not only navigate a city but to also change it, through culture and infrastructure. I hope this project illuminates some of the impact that the bicycle has had on these cities."
